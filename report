# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## 1. Executive Summary
This assessment was conducted in a controlled lab environment using Nessus Essentials to scan the Metasploitable 2 VM.  
The purpose was to identify vulnerabilities, assess their severity, and demonstrate remediation planning as part of a cybersecurity portfolio project.

**Key Findings:**
- [8] Critical vulnerabilities
- [5] High vulnerabilities
- [18] Medium vulnerabilities
- [8] Low vulnerabilities
- [77] Informational items

## 2. Scope
- **Target System:** Metasploitable 2  
- **IP Address:** 192.168.56.101  
- **Tool Used:** Nessus Essentials  
- **Date of Scan:** 9/2/2025

## 3. Methodology
1. Installed and configured Nessus Essentials.  
2. Created a Basic Network Scan targeting the Metasploitable 2 VM.  
3. Ran the scan and exported results in CSV and HTML.  
4. Analyzed vulnerabilities by severity.
